COCO MADEMOISELLE
EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY


description
The essence of a bold, free woman. An airy, sensual, feminine ambery.

composition
An ambery-fresh, fruity and airy accord.
Top notes of Sicilian grapefruit deliver an intense freshness, before giving way to a floral heart with a blend of rose and jasmine petals, punctuated with a fruity lychee note. Softened base notes provide a unique and boldly seductive trail.

inspiration
COCO MADEMOISELLE draws its inspiration from the fascinating personality of Gabrielle Chanel. The fragrance is the olfactory reflection of an independent thinker who breaks the rules to create her own. The portrait of a woman ready to daringly write her own destiny.

art of perfuming
The eau de toilette comes in a spray format for a more generous use, with an effortless application on skin or inside clothing.

A complete perfuming ritual for the bath and body is also available to enhance the fragrance trail.
