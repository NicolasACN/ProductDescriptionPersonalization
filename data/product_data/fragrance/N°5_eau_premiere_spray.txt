N°5
EAU PREMIÈRE SPRAY

description
N°5, the very essence of femininity. A soft and luminous aldehyde floral bouquet. A timeless, legendary fragrance housed in an iconic bottle with a minimalist design.

composition
A floral, luminous and airy interpretation of N°5.
The voluptuousness of Ylang-Ylang from the Comoros blends into the harmonious and delicate facets of May Rose and Jasmine. Aldehydes grant it a unique presence, and the smooth touch of Vanilla and musky notes create an incredibly feminine trail.

inspiration
In 1921, Gabrielle Chanel asked Ernest Beaux to create "a woman's perfume with a woman's scent", rare and powerful. The nose presented her with a visionary composition that made unprecedented use of aldehydes. Mademoiselle chose the fifth sample of the fragrance, and decided to name it simply N°5. In 2008, Jacques Polge, the CHANEL nose since 1978, reinterpreted his predecessor's composition to create a luminous version of N°5: EAU PREMIÈRE.

art of perfuming
EAU PREMIÈRE is a fragrance meant for more generous use, with smooth and supple application on skin or inside clothing. To revive the notes of the fragrance throughout the day, the refillable spray is a practical travel format you can slip into your purse and take with you anywhere. A complete perfuming ritual for the bath and body is also available, an ideal way to enhance the scent trail of the fragrance.
