N°19
EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY

description
A daring, distinctive fragrance. The vibrant, green notes of Galbanum blend with the powdery notes of Iris to strike a perfect balance. The last fragrance launched and worn by Gabrielle Chanel. An uncompromising composition, in the image of Mademoiselle.

composition
A daring floral-woody-green fragrance that plays with contrasts.
A perfect balance between the vibrant, green notes of Galbanum and the soft, powdery notes of Iris Pallida. A rich, smooth variation with a greater floral dimension, heightened by Ylang-Ylang, Lily-of-the-Valley and Rose.

inspiration
N°19 is the other great number by CHANEL.

The last fragrance Gabrielle Chanel ever launched or wore. A fragrance that pays tribute to the day she was born: August 19, 1883.

When the idea for this new women's fragrance came to mind, she met with resistance from those around her who did not think a new fragrance could exist alongside N°5. But Coco refused to give up and asked Henri Robert for a composition with a personality just as strong as that of N°5. And her request was granted, in a completely different olfactory composition: a contrasting accord of green and powdery notes. Mademoiselle passed away just a few weeks after the launch of the new fragrance, on January 10, 1971.

"To be irreplaceable, you must be different": N°19 is the final masterpiece from this extraordinary, daring and radiant female personality.

art of perfuming
For a more generous application, the eau de parfum comes in a spray format allowing for an easy and effortless application on skin or inside clothing.

A complete perfuming ritual for the bath and body is also used to enhance its trail of scent.
