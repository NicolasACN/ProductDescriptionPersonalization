An abstract fragrance that reveals a delectably powdered bouquet, the N°5 Parfum is the quintessence of femininity.

inspiration
In 1921, Gabrielle Chanel asked Ernest Beaux to create "a woman's perfume with a woman's scent", rare and powerful. The nose presented her with a visionary composition that made unprecedented use of aldehydes. Mademoiselle chose the fifth sample of the fragrance, and decided to name it simply N°5. For this new fragrance, she opted for a bottle with a radical design, adorned with a white label and topped with a faceted cabochon. The unprecedented scent of the fragrance, along with its simple name and bottle, revolutionised the history of perfumery. N°5 has become a true cult fragrance.

art of perfuming
The parfum is the quintessence of a fragrance, with its own specific application. Gabrielle Chanel's advice was to apply it "wherever you would like to be kissed."Neck, wrist, décolleté,… Dab a drop on your body's pulse points, wherever you can feel a heart beat. To revive the notes of the fragrance throughout the day, the refillable spray is a practical travel format you can slip into your purse and take with you anywhere.
