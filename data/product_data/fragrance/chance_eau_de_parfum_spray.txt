inspiration
It comes and goes, it never stays still... and you only have a few seconds to seize your chance. It is unpredictable and appears when you least expect it, but if you decide to seize it, anything is possible.
"A chance came up, I seized it." Mademoiselle Chanel knew that her real chance was the one of her own creation, a state of mind, a way of being.

art of perfuming
The eau de parfum comes in a spray format for an effortless application on skin or inside clothing.

A complete perfuming ritual for the bath and body is also used to enhance the fragrance trail.
