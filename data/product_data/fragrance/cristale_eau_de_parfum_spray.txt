A floral-fresh fragrance with pure elegance.
A vibrant, delicate composition that opens with a fresh and fruity burst. The heart blossoms with green notes of Hyacinth, softened with a Honeysuckle accord. A fragrance with a trail of scent tinged with Absolutes of Jasmine and Iris from Florence.

The eau de parfum comes in a spray format for an effortless application on skin or inside clothing.

A perfuming ritual for the bath and body is also available to enhance the fragrance trail.
